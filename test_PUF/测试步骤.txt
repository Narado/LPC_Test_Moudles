1) Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the target board.
2) Build and download flashloader (mcu-sdk-2.0/boards/lpcxpresso54s018m/bootloader_examples/flashloader) to the board.
3) Run flashloader on board and start executing blhost.exe commands
4) PUF enroll (generate activation code into key store): blhost -p COM# -- key-provisioning enroll
5) generate  UDS : blhost -p COM# -- key-provisioning set_user_key 2 key.bin,32           (UDS key type = 2, key.bin is hex file with our key that we encrypt) 
6) upload the key store in to the PC   : blhost -p COM# -- key-provisioning read_key_store key_store.bin  
7) Get activation code and UDS keycode from key_store.bin : 
   i. first 1192 bytes of key_store.bin is activation code which needs to be copied into uint8_t activationCode[PUF_ACTIVATION_CODE_SIZE] array in source file puf_flashloader_test.c 
   ii. key code size is 52 bytes long and can be located on offset 0x04DC in key_store.bin and needs to be copied into uint8_t keyCode1[] array in source file puf_flashloader_test.c
8) Build and download puf_flashloader_test to the target board
9) Open a serial terminal with the following settings:  - 115200 baud rate ; - 8 data bits;  - No parity;  - One stop bit;  - No flow control
10) In terminal you should be able to see reconstructed key, as same as the content of key.bin in step 5)
The log below shows the output of the PUF flashloader test in the terminal window (the key value will vary):
